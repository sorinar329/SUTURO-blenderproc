# SUTURO-blenderproc
Blenderproc implementation for the SUTURO Project

Pls put the SUTURO-blenderproc and the the project with scenes in a workspace. 

To run the test pipeline you can type the following command in the CLI:

`blenderproc run main.py --config_yaml=toy_config --scene=storing_groceries`

where config_yaml should be any yaml file located at data/yaml and scene is a blender scene, 
which should be located in a seperate project in a workspace folder.
